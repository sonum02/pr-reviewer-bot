# PR Monitor

## Note: This Project is work in progress so will update the Readme as I go

## Project Overview
The GitHub Pull Request Reviewer Bot is an AI-powered automation tool that reviews pull requests (PRs) using Large Language Models (LLMs). The bot provides automated feedback on code quality, security vulnerabilities, best practices, and documentation completeness.


## Benefits
- Improved Code Quality: Automated checks help maintain high code quality by catching issues early in the development process.
- Consistency: Enforces consistent coding standards across the codebase.
- Efficiency: Saves time for developers by automating repetitive tasks and providing immediate feedback.
- Collaboration: Keeps the team informed about code quality issues through automated notifications, facilitating better collaboration and quicker resolution of issues.
